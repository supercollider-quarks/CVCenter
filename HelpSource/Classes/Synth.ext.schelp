subsection:: Extensions by CVCenter

method:: cvcGui
Creates code::CVWidget::s for the controls of a running code::Synth::.

argument:: displayDialog
If set to code::false:: widgets will be created immediately without allowing to edit specs ahead from creation.

argument:: prefix
As code::CVCenter.all:: cannot contain a name twice you may add a custom prefix to avoid CVCenter from trying to overwrite existing keys.

argument:: pairs2D
An code::Event:: that creates a code::CVWidget2D:: rather than a code::CVWidgetKnob:: for the given control-names and the given widget-name:

code::(widgetName1: #[controlName1_lo, controlName1_hi], widgetName2: #[controlName2_lo, controlName2_hi, â€¦ widgetNameN: #[controlNameN_lo, controlNameN_hi])::

argument:: environment
If the code::Synth:: is stored in an code::Environment:: which is different from your code::currentEnvironment:: this environment may be passed in explicitly.

returns:: this (a code::Synth::)
